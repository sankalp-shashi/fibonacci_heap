# fibonacci_heap
Keep dijkstra.c and functions.c in the same folder.
We were unable to get dijkstra.c functioning before the deadline (it results in an infinite loop), but the fibonacci heap functions work fine, in fibonacci.c.
Compile and run as usual
	gcc "filename.c"
	./a.out

functions.c is not meant to be compiled, it is just a collection of functions.

input for fibonacci.c is not needed.

input for dijkstra:
	Enter the number of vertices in your graph
	Enter whether the graph is directed or undirected.
	Enter edges and weights separated by a space. For example, if there is an edge from vertex 3 to vertex 4 of weight 1, enter:
	3 4 1
	Finally enter the source vertex.
